#CPU JOB Scheduling

In this project I have implemented CPU Job Scheduling algorithms.
To start, go to datagen folder on your command prompt and use.

make
./datagen
./datagenRR
./datagen_mq

This will generate random data.

Now, go to algorithms folder in cmd and,
make
./my_program

for each algorithm.
The output for each algorithm with the stats will be then available in the outputs folder.

To clean each folder of executables and text files, use

make clean

in that particular directory.

About:
This Project was done to implement the CPU Job Scheduling algorithms for my DA 212 lab course.

A special thanks to our instructors Dr. Gaurav Trivedi, Dr. Arghyadip Roy
and to the teaching assistants, Mr. Anupam Kumar Mr. Pallapu Mohan Krishna,
without whom this project wouldn't have been possible.
